# Logic Gates Task (AND and XOR)

This repository contains the solution for the Logic Gates project, implementing AND and XOR gates using neural networks within a Jupyter Notebook.

## Repository Contents

* `Logic_Gates_Notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the logic gate solutions.
* `README.md`: This file, explaining the repository contents and how to run the code.

## Jupyter Notebook Description

The Jupyter Notebook includes the following sections:

1.  **AND Gate Implementation:**
    * Implementation of the AND gate using a simple neural network.
    * Display of training results (weights and bias).
    * Display of the predicted truth table.
2.  **XOR Gate Implementation (Addition):**
    * Implementation of the XOR gate using a neural network with a hidden layer.
    * Display of training results (weights and biases).
    * Display of the predicted truth table.

## How to Run

1.  Ensure you have the following libraries installed:
    * `numpy`
    * `tensorflow`
    * `IPython`
2.  Open the Jupyter Notebook (`Logic_Gates_Notebook.ipynb`) in a Jupyter environment or Google Colab.
3.  Run the cells sequentially.

## Notes

* The sigmoid activation function is used in the neural networks.
* The SGD algorithm is used for training.
* The XOR gate solution has been added to the Jupyter Notebook.
